Some governments like to censor journalists.

Those governments also like to cite anti-secession laws and force journalists to take down videos on those grounds.

If you see good journalism that is doing an excellent job as the [4th Estate], exposing the dark side of the society<strike> and government</strike>, you should download their videos and backup when possible. 

Once it gets taken down, there is no going back.

Do your part, conserve the truth and history of your country.
